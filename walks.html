        <div class="grand-canal-walk">
            <img src="assets/images/dublin-kavanagh.jpg" alt="A picture of Patrick Kavanagh">
        <span class="caption">A stroll along the Grand Canal may make you think of Venice, but it’s also one of the best Dublin walks around. Start this walk on Mount Street bridge. 
            There is a memorial here commemorating the Battle of Mount Street Bridge. The GPO and Boland’s Mill may be the highest profile locations celebrated in the history of 1916 Easter Rising, but Irish rebels also fought the British here where Mount Street and Northumberland Road come together. 
            Dublin’s Grand Canal features a path along the water that alternates between a dirt and paved track. Look for herons fishing and moorhens darting among the reeds. If you’re lucky, you may see a boat traversing the locks. Keep an eye out for writer Patrick Kavanagh’s statue which will forever be relaxing cross-legged along the Grand Canal near Baggot Street. 
            Continue on and you may find crowds gathered on a sunny day outside the Barge Inn pub. Go as far as Portobello and you might be treated to a bevy of swans gliding across the water looking for generous walkers to give them a treat. Do the swans a favor and don’t throw them bread. Signs along the Grand Canal advise to only feed swans foods like oats, corn, and defrosted frozen peas.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/dublin-botanic.jpg" alt="A picture of the Botanic Gardens">
            <span class="caption">Look for the gate connecting the National Botanic Gardens with Glasnevin Cemetery. 
            Glasnevin is the ideal place for a quiet reflective walk and a a crash course on Irish history. 
            Take a walking tour of Glasnevin Cemetery and you'll find yourself regaled with stories from the time of Daniel O'Connell (aka "The Liberator") through the 20th century and the era of Irish independence. O'Connell commissioned and funded the cemetery as a non-denominational resting place and you’ll find his tomb beneath a tall tower. Look for Irish writer Brendan Behan’s grave. On the anniversary of his death, you’ll find his headstone covered with pints of Guinness. 
            Glasnevin Cemetery Museum is located on the premises along with a cafe and other facilities.

            <img src="assets/images/dublin-killiney.webp" alt="A picture of Killiney Hill">
            <p>Just outside the city, the Killiney Hill walk offers guests a tremendous view of the surrounding area. 
            Depending on whether you choose the short option or the longer option, it can take 20 to 45 minutes to reach the top of the hill, which is marked by a large obelisk, built in the 18th century. From the summit, you can take in panoramic views of Dublin or, to the other side, the Wicklow Mountains. 
            When coming back down the hill, be sure to stop off at the Druid’s Chair Pub for a post-hike pint.</p>
