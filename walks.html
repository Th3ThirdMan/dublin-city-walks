        <div class="grand-canal-walk">The Grand Canal Walk</div>
        <div class="grand-canal-text">
            A stroll along the Grand Canal may make you think of Venice, but it’s also one of the best Dublin walks
            around. Start this walk on Mount Street bridge.
            There is a memorial here commemorating the Battle of Mount Street Bridge. The GPO and Boland’s Mill may be
            the highest profile locations celebrated in the history of 1916 Easter Rising, but Irish rebels also fought
            the British here where Mount Street and Northumberland Road come together.
            Dublin’s Grand Canal features a path along the water that alternates between a dirt and paved track. Look
            for herons fishing and moorhens darting among the reeds. If you’re lucky, you may see a boat traversing the
            locks. Keep an eye out for writer Patrick Kavanagh’s statue which will forever be relaxing cross-legged
            along the Grand Canal near Baggot Street.
            Continue on and you may find crowds gathered on a sunny day outside the Barge Inn pub. Go as far as
            Portobello and you might be treated to a bevy of swans gliding across the water looking for generous walkers
            to give them a treat. Do the swans a favor and don’t throw them bread. Signs along the Grand Canal advise to
            only feed swans foods like oats, corn, and defrosted frozen peas.

        <div class="botanic-gardens">The Botanic Gardens</div>
        <div class="botanic-gardens-text">
            Look for the gate connecting the National Botanic Gardens with Glasnevin Cemetery.
            Glasnevin is the ideal place for a quiet reflective walk and a a crash course on Irish history.
            Take a walking tour of Glasnevin Cemetery and you'll find yourself regaled with stories from the time of
            Daniel O'Connell (aka "The Liberator") through the 20th century and the era of Irish independence.
            O'Connell commissioned and funded the cemetery as a non-denominational resting place and you’ll find his
            tomb beneath a tall tower. Look for Irish writer Brendan Behan’s grave. On the anniversary of his death,
            you’ll find his headstone covered with pints of Guinness.
            Glasnevin Cemetery Museum is located on the premises along with a cafe and other facilities.

        <div class="dublin-killiney">Killiney Hill Walk</div>
        <div class="dublin-killiney-text">
            Just outside the city, the Killiney Hill walk offers guests a tremendous view of the surrounding area.
            Depending on whether you choose the short option or the longer option, it can take 20 to 45 minutes to reach
            the top of the hill, which is marked by a large obelisk, built in the 18th century.
            From the summit, you can take in panoramic views of Dublin or, to the other side, the Wicklow Mountains.
            When coming back down the hill, be sure to stop off at the Druid’s Chair Pub for a post-hike pint.

        <div class="great-south-walk">The Great South Wall Walk</div>
        <div class="great-south-text">
            Part of Dublin Port, the Great South Wall is one of Europe’s longest sea walls. Built in the 18th century,
            it stretches 4km (2.5mi) out into Dublin Bay from a starting point at the inner suburb of Ringsend.
            While 360-degree views of all of coastal Dublin are reason enough to undertake this walk, many go just to
            see the emblematic Poolbeg Lighthouse,
            a quintessential Dublin landmark located almost smack in the centre of the bay.

        <div class="dublin-park-phoenix">Phoenix Park Walk</div>
        <div class="dublin-park-text">
            The Phoenix Park is thought to be the largest enclosed urban park in Europe. Head to the Visitor Centre and
            Ashtown Castle,
            a medieval tower house with beginnings in the 15th century.
            At the nearby Phoenix Café you can pick up a curated picnic in the park to sustain you while you explore.
            Nature lovers will want to keep an eye out for the fallow deer who also live here. There are many walking
            trails to choose from.
            Take the 6.4km route, which begins at the Magazine Fort off Military Road, and continue to the Hole in the
            Wall pub on the outskirts of the park. Another 6km walk starts from the Castleknock Road entrance and
            travels along Chesterfield Avenue passing Dublin Zoo on the way.
