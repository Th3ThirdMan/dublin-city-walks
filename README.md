# Design

<br>

## Colour Schemes

<br>

* For the colour schema of the website I largely drew from a personal aesthetic in a protracted and considered fashion. I mixed and matched colours that I felt coincided well off the palette. The body colourway proved to be the most regularly amended and I finally resolved on rgba(10, 23, 34, 0.712). I think this colour set well with the images placed within the main body of the website, in particular on the Walks page.

* Navbar links and Heading text in the Home page were offered the unadventurous, but stellar rgb(255, 255, 255). This worked well and in keeping with a simple and understated look, but nonetheless, a classic design.

* Hover options on navigation links and social media icons yielded a rgb(245, 73, 6) for good contrast.

<br>

## Font Families

<br>

* Font Families included Serif, Helvetica, Source Sans Pro for the Body. I felt that Serif complimented the unfussiness of the webpages, especially for navigation links and welcome text. It added a clarity and refinedness that the pages deserved. 

* Roboto was utilised for text information in the Walks page. This went well with the lightness in attitude of the Walks page. Roboto added to those descriptions, also complimenting the character of the Walks descriptions.

# Features

<br>


## Navigation

<br>

   * The Navigation Bar is featured on all 4 pages of the website.

   * The top left-hand side of the page features the website Name: Dublin City Walks. There is no active link attached to this logo.

   * Active navigation links reside to the top right-hand side of the page. They are as follows: Home, Walks, Gallery, Contact. These link to 3 further separate pages in the website.

   * The links created give a good overview of what the website is conveying and creates a simplistic, clean view of how one should navigate the site. 

   * Prevailing colours for the Navigation bar were designed in a contrasting black and white *(Figure 1.1)*

   * A hover red option with a text decoration underline is present on all Navigation links on all pages *(Figure 1.2)*  

   * A hamburger menu was initially entertained and created, but the inclusion of JavaScript felt it wouldn't be within the remit of Portfolio requirements. This could be an option for later Portfolio submissions.

## The Home Page, Images & Description

<br>

  * The Home Page consists of the quintessentially unmistakeable backdrop of an iconic landmark in that of the H'apenny Bridge. Plenty of feet have tread this bridge for centuries so it felt appropriate to make this a centrepoint image on the landing page.

  * The logo sentiment is reiterated and also an added textual sentiment is present to indicate that Dublin is an exciting city that is built for walking.

  * The image adopts a transform and zoom element which gives depth upon opening the page. 

  * The smaller images coupled with text give more than just a visual representation, plus it gives a taste of the history of Dublin when people partake in walks around the city.

  ## The Walks Page

  <br>

  * The Walks Page consists of a primary 40em image with an eye-catching text description of the best walks available to anyone who visits the site.

  * There is a varied amount of imagery depicting the landscape, but there is context to each location drawing from Irish literature to scenic vistas. This gives the reader a sense of not only the prospect of a nice walk, but an historical outlay of what's worth visiting in Dublin. 

  * Links at the base of the page give the visitor an option to visit the Gallery or Contact Page.

  <br><br>

  ## The Gallery Page

  <br>

  * The Gallery Page highlights a myriad of vistas and points of interest around Dublin City. It gives a nice visual of what visitors to the site could come to expect about this location.

  * Links at the base of the page give options for a reader to visit the Contact Page seamlessly.

  <br><br>

  ## The Contact Us Page

  <br>

  * The Contact Page is an essential part of the website where users can get in touch to ask more about the website and the content inside of it. In the case of this Contact Page it invites visitors to provide their e-mail details so they can subscribe to a newsletter.

  <br><br>

  ## Footer

  <br>

  * The footer section links work as designed and lead a user to the appropriate websites when the icons are clicked.

  * They are aligned closely together, centered, with a flex display.

  * Hover options on social media icons yielded a rgb(245, 73, 6) for good contrast.

  * The icons were imported from Font Awesome as outlined in the index.html file with a JavaScript link.

  # Future Features

  * Build out the Contact Page to a more in-depth query based form, with a textarea and submit button, prompting visitors to the site to be more expansive in their thoughts and have the ability to put questions to the business or site owner.

  * Add in an Upcoming Walks feature that will turn previous visitors into return visitors.

  * Employing a Map feature which indicates where all the walking locations are.

  <br><br>

  # Bugs

  <br>

  * I encountered a few issues where the site didn't meet my intended expectations. This primarily resided in the arena of responsiveness when viewing the screen at mobile level. The navigation bar was reflected as a desktop view when rendered down to a mobile screen. A fix for this was to employ the flex property to adjust this issue and view the website in a proper mobile aspect.

  * I encountered issues with the sub-images and text on the landing page. A container class worked well here with the images and text, assuming an equality to both, which helped when viewing on lower height and width screens.

  * Again with the sub-images on the Welcome page the images didn't align correctly as per my expectation, but through testing and research the background-size property played a part in correcting this.

  <br><br>

  # Unfixed Bugs

  <br>

  * There were no unfixed bugs.

  <br><br>

    # Credits

    <br>

      The project was well supported via various channels within the Slack application. There was a lot of information posted up on the myriad of difficulties that arose throughout the project. Suffice to say, this was a great help in understanding issues and also a good opportunity to ask some questions of my own. The support and knowledge offered in these channels was a very valuable resource and helped massively to aid project completion. 

      Indubitably, notable mentions must also be offered in respect to the advice imparted by the sagely Chris Quinn. He was constructive and knowledgeable when it came to pointing me in the right direction and offering up advice on areas that proved troublesome. Thanks Chris.

      I also want to offer up a word of thanks to David Bowers, the Slack Support Supremo. His advice towards the latter part of the project proved the elixir to get things where they needed to be for submission. His Super Solutions avatar is definitely a fitting one. The speed at which this guy works is extraordinary! His advice was brilliant to say the least, and his ability to explain concepts to lesser mortals in such a rudimentary fashion is a skill very few can master. Thanks David.
