# Design

## Colour Schemes

<br>

* For the colour schema of the website I largely drew from a personal aesthetic in an alarmingly painstaking fashion, mixing and matching colours that I felt coincided well off the palette. The body colourway proved to be the most regularly amended and I finally resolved on rgba(16, 35, 54, 0.692). I think this colour set well with the Images placed within the main body of the website, in particular the Walks page.

* Navbar links and Heading text in the Home page were offered the unadventurous, but stellar rgb(255, 255, 255). This worked well and in keeping with simple, understated but classic design.

* Hover options on navigation links and social media icons yielded a rgb(245, 73, 6) for good contrast.

<br>

## Font Families

<br>

* Font Families included Serif, Helvetica, Source Sans Pro for the Body. I felt that Serif complimented the unfussiness of the webpages, especially for navigation links and welcome text. It added a clarity and refinedness that the pages deserved. 

* Roboto was utilised for text information in the Walks page. This went well with the lightness in attitude of the Walks page. Roboto added to those descriptions, also complimenting the character of the walk descriptions.

# Features



## Navigation

<br>

   * The Navigation Bar is featured on all 4 pages of the website.

   * The top left-hand side of the page features the website Name: Dublin City Walks. There is no active link attached to this logo.

   * Active navigation links reside to the top right-hand side of the page. They are as follows: Home, Walks, Gallery, Contact. These link to 3 further separate pages in the website.

   * The links created give a good overview of what the website is conveying and creates a simplistic, clean view of how one should navigate the site. 

   * Prevailing colours for the Navigation bar were designed in a contrasting black and white *(Figure 1.1)*

   * A hover red option with a text decoration underline is present on all Navigation links on all pages *(Figure 1.2)*  

   * A hamburger menu was initially entertained and created, but the inclusion of JavaScripting felt it wouldn't be within the remit of Portfolio requirements. This would be an option for later Portfolio submissions.

## The Home Page, Images & Description

<br>

  * The Home Page consists of the quintessentially unmistakeable backdrop of an iconic landmark in that of the H'apenny Bridge. Plenty of feet have tread this bridge for centuries so it felt appropriate to make this a centrepoint image on the landing page.

  * The logo sentiment is reiterated and also an added textual sentiment is present to indicate that Dublin is an exciting city that is built for walking.

  * The image adopts a transform and zoom element which gives depth upon opening the page. 

  * The smaller images coupled with text give more than just a visual representation, plus it gives a taste of the history of Dublin when people partake walks around the city.

  * The Walks Page consists of a primary 40em image with an eye-catching text description of the best walks available to anyone who visits the site.
